# Problem

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return _the number of combinations that make up that amount_. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `0`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

The answer is **guaranteed** to fit into a signed **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** amount = 3, coins = [2]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** amount = 10, coins = [10]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= coins.length <= 300`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 5000`
- All the values of `coins` are **unique**.
- `0 <= amount <= 5000`

# Solve
## Dynamic programming
The ideal start with a update function:
```
stage_a + coin_value -> stage_b = stage_<a+ coin_value>
```

Which lead to:
```
total_way_of_stage_b = total_way_of_stage_a (with coin_value) + <other_way>
```

With every coins, we loop and adding up the total way to reach each amount.
```java
class Solution {
    public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
        int[] count = new int[amount + 1];
        count[0] = 1;
        for (int i : coins) {
            for (int c = i; c <= amount; c++) {
                count[c] += count[c-i];
            }
        }
        return count[amount];
    }
}
```

> The for loop odder have an impact on how the Calculation run:

If you instead doing this:
```java
for (int c = 0; c <= amount; c++) {
    for (int i : coins) {
        if (c-i > 0) 
            count[c] += count[c-i];
    }
}
```
- We have total of way adding coin (that count with all possible different position `1 2 1 != 1 1 2`) to reach that amount
# Comparing
I also try some more language to help me familiar with other language array too, it quite surprise to see rust and java beat c in runtime.
## `java`: 
We have `int` array automate initiation as 0
## `c`:
It keep yelling me about how I can't using `int count[amount+1] = {0}`; This just mean I have to use a hard code value to use this feature of the language.
```c
#define MAX_AMOUNT 5001
int count[MAX_AMOUNT] = {0};
```

To initiation use a variable size, we instead use `memset`.
Also, C not have `for each` built-in the language syntax, so I use a normal iterator loop
```c
int change(int amount, int* coins, int coinsSize){
    int count[amount + 1];
    memset(count, 0, sizeof(count));  
    count[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < coinsSize; i++) {
        for (int c = coins[i]; c <= amount; c++) {
            count[c] += count[c-coins[i]];
        }
    }
    return count[amount];
}
```

> For an un-know reason, but it c quite slow some time when I try to submit result.
## `python3`:
I can't seem to know better way to initiation a array in python. Also, I use python to make my first implementation, planning process.

```python
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        count = [0] * (amount + 1)
        count[0] = 1
        for i in coins:
            for c in range(amount+1):
                if c-i < 0:
                    continue
                count[c] += count[c-i]
                
        return count[amount]
```
## `rust`:
While rust have some more similar way to create array like `c`, it require the variable to be constant example. 
```rust
const MAX_AMOUNT: usize = 5000;
let mut count = [0; MAX_AMOUNT];
```

- To create and allocation array, using dynamic size variable, we have to use `vec!` 

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn change(amount: i32, coins: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
        let mut count = vec![0; (amount + 1) as usize];
        count[0] = 1;
        
        for coin in coins {
            for c in coin..=amount {
                count[c as usize] += count[(c - coin) as usize];
            }
        }
        
        count[amount as usize]
    }
}
```
