# Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `p`. Find `p` pairs of indices of `nums` such that the **maximum** difference amongst all the pairs is **minimized**. Also, ensure no index appears more than once amongst the `p` pairs.

Note that for a pair of elements at the index `i` and `j`, the difference of this pair is `|nums[i] - nums[j]|`, where `|x|` represents the **absolute** **value** of `x`.

Return _the **minimum** **maximum** difference among all_ `p` _pairs._ We define the maximum of an empty set to be zero.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [10,1,2,7,1,3], p = 2
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The first pair is formed from the indices 1 and 4, and the second pair is formed from the indices 2 and 5. 
The maximum difference is max(|nums[1] - nums[4]|, |nums[2] - nums[5]|) = max(0, 1) = 1. Therefore, we return 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [4,2,1,2], p = 1
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** Let the indices 1 and 3 form a pair. The difference of that pair is |2 - 2| = 0, which is the minimum we can attain.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `0 <= p <= (nums.length)/2`

        # by example [1,2,3,4] right next to each other
        # -> We can only choing [1,2] [3,4] or [2,3] [1,4]. But because of sorting
        # [1,4] > any of ([1,2] [2,3] [3,4])
