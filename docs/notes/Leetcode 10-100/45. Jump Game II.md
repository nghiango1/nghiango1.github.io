## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums` of length `n`. You are initially positioned at `nums[0]`.

Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index `i`. In other words, if you are at `nums[i]`, you can jump to any `nums[i + j]` where:

- `0 <= j <= nums[i]` and
- `i + j < n`

Return _the minimum number of jumps to reach_ `nums[n - 1]`. The test cases are generated such that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
**Output:** 2

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10**4`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- It's guaranteed that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.
## Solve

### Water falling
(language:: python) (time:: O(n))

Following a minimized greedy/dynamic programming minimized path problem from graph.
- Calling the `minimum` array is to store the total minimal step needed to reach each element, `minimum[i]` correspond to `element[i]`. At first, `minimum` array isn't set, as none element is being processed.
- We start at `index=0`, cost `step=0` jump step. As we already start at the first element. This also mean we have `minimum[0] = 0`
- From next, we start a loop
    - We find a element with index `pos` that have minimum `step` value, that is not visited/process
    - Flag it as already visited
    - Update all other element our current `pos` can jump into new minimum (`step + 1`) if it either uninitialized or it currently have a less optimal total of step need to jump into.

This is when I also realized we dealing with a serial of number, a special case of graph data:
- The minimum jump step to each element isn't change value after initialized.

> So that mean we can just skip most of the unnecessary loop to update the `minimum`.

```python
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        p = 0
        minimum = [-1] * n
        minimum[0] = 0
        q = [(0, 0)]
        while q:
            pos, step = q.pop(0)
            for npos in range(p, min(n, pos + nums[pos]+1)):
                if minimum[npos] == -1:
                    minimum[npos] = step + 1
                    q.append((npos, step + 1))
                    p = npos
        return minimum[-1]
```

So I calling it water fall basically because the height being collapsing all at once (this is visualization process on white board)

Time complexity: (time:: O(n))
- BFS: Each `minimum` is updated once, visited once;
- DP update loop: By updating temporary `p` pointer, the nested loop only run in total n times independent with the total time BFS queue call (thus not our time complexity isn't multiple to O(n^2) ).
