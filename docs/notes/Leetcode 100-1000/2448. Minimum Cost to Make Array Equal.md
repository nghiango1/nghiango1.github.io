## Problem

You are given two 0-indexed arrays `nums` and cost consisting each of n positive integers.

You can do the following operation any number of times:

Increase or decrease any element of the array `nums` by 1.
The cost of doing one operation on the `i-th` element is `cost[i]`.

Return the minimum total cost such that all the elements of the array `nums` become equal.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,2], cost = [2,3,1,14]
Output: 8
Explanation: We can make all the elements equal to 2 in the following way:
- Increase the 0th element one time. The cost is 2.
- Decrease the 1st element one time. The cost is 3.
- Decrease the 2nd element three times. The cost is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
The total cost is 2 + 3 + 3 = 8.
It can be shown that we cannot make the array equal with a smaller cost.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], cost = [4,2,8,1,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: All the elements are already equal, so no operations are needed.
```

**Constraints:**
- `n == nums.length == cost.length`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i], cost[i] <= 106`

## Solution

### Overview
1. **Assuming** result always try to match one of the number inside the array
- It easy to conclude that the `equal value` that we trying to find in in between min - max of the array (or else they are the min or max of the array)
- We can just using binary search if the assumption isn't true, with left and right start at min - max


2.  If you can calculate the cost given a specific equal value it in `O(1)` time. The handling process rely on the fact that if you can separating all the increase / decrease part of the array, with each change quickly or not.
	- After sorting the provided `nums`, which cost `O(n log n)`
	- We can separating increase / decrease part  in half by `O(1)` if we tryout each `nums` in sorted order; or `O(log n)` in-case we using binary search
	- Then the problem becoming `O(n)` to tryout all `nums`; or `O(log (max - min))` in-case we using binary search
	- We can achieve `O(1)` time complexity calculate the cost given a specific equal value this by just pre-calculating all array range with Dynamic Programming Sub array-Sum
	- Overall, a `O(n log n) + O(n)*O(1)` or `O(n log n) + O(log n)* O(log (max - min)) *O(1)`

## Implement
### `O(n log n) + O(n)*O(1)`
```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, nums: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        arr = list(zip(nums, cost))
        arr.sort()
        sumCost = [0] * len(arr)
        for i, (_, cost) in enumerate(arr):
            sumCost[i] += cost
            if i > 0:
                sumCost[i] += sumCost[i-1]

        def sumRange(sumCost, left, right):
            if left == -1:
                return sumCost[right]
            return sumCost[right] - sumCost[left]

        minNums = min(nums)
        res = [0] * len(arr)
        res[0] = sum([(num - minNums) * cost for num, cost in arr])

        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            preNum, preCost = arr[i-1]
            num, cost = arr[i]
            res[i] = res[i - 1]
            res[i] += sumRange(sumCost, -1, i-1) * (-preNum + num)
            res[i] -= sumRange(sumCost, i-1, len(arr) - 1) * (num - preNum)

        return min(res)
```

### `O(n log n) + O(log n)* O(log (max - min)) *O(1)` (WRONG - FIRST THOUGHT THO)
```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, nums: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        arr = list(zip(nums, cost))
        arr.sort()
        sumCost = [0] * len(arr)
        for i, (_, cost) in enumerate(arr):
            sumCost[i] += cost
            if i > 0:
                sumCost[i] += sumCost[i-1]

        def sumRange(sumCost, left, right):
            if left == -1:
                return sumCost[right]
            return sumCost[right] - sumCost[left]

        minNums = min(nums)
        exampleRes = sum([(num - minNums) * cost for num, cost in arr])

		def findCut(arr, value):
			left = -1
			right = len(arr)
			while True:
				mid = (left + right)// 2
				if left == mid:
					break
				if arr[mid] <= value:
					left = mid
				else:
					right = mid
			return right
			
        maxNums = max(nums)
		left = minNums-1
		right = maxNums+1
        while True:
	        mid = (left + right)// 2
            cutIndex = findCut(arr, mid)
            testRes = exampleRes
            testRes += sumRange(sumCost, -1, cutIndex) * (num - minNums)
            testRes -= sumRange(sumCost, cutIndex, len(arr) - 1) * (num -  minNums)

        return min(res)
```
