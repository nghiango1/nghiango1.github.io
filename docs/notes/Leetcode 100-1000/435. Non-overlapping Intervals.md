# Problem

Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return _the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping_.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 105`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `-5 * 104 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104`

**Example 1:**
```markdown
**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3|1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
```

## Bottom-up dynamic programming
Dynamic problem, which is a lot similar to [[2008. Maximum Earnings From Taxi|2008. Maximum Earnings From Taxi]], [[1751. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II|1751. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II]], we try to minimize the value of total element you want to remove.

This is bottom-up approach, where we focus on solve and building necessary all lower information first :
- Sort all intervals by end value, this to ensure when we calculate result of a interval `[s_i, e_i]`, we can already get the best result from range `[...e_i-1]`.
- Try to find the best result `cacheResult[i]` on each step `[s_i, e_i]`, either:
    - *Case 1*: Remove our current interval, meaning `cacheResult[e_i] = cacheResult[e_i-1] +1`
    - *Case 2*: Use our current interval, meaning `cacheResult[e_i] = cacheResult[s_i-1] + <total_of_interval_between_s_i_and_e_i> `
- To do this, I keeping track of already processed `interval` in `cacheKey` array, while `cacheResult` keeping the best result of our current set interval of `cacheKey`, adding them key by key.
    - The expression of above *Case 1*, and *Case 2* replace by calculating using `index` of current processed interval and `key` value in  `cacheKey` array.
    - `bisect_right` here is a perform a literal binary searching on already sorted array `cacheKey` (by default, as we already sort the `intervals` by end value), which get the `closest` index where `key[closest-1] <= value < key[closest]`. Here I need to check some [[Off by one error|Off by one error]] to find the exact equivalence.

```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def getEnds(interval):
            return interval[1]
        
        intervals.sort(key = getEnds)
        cacheResult = []
        cacheKey = []
        for i, (s, e) in enumerate(intervals):
            cacheKey.append(e)
            if i == 0:
                cacheResult[0] = 0
                continue
            closest = bisect_right(cacheKey, s) - 1
            cacheResult.append(cacheResult[i-1] + 1)
            if closest >= 0:
                cacheResult[i] = min(cacheResult[i], cacheResult[closest] + i - closest -1)
            
        return cacheResult[len(intervals) -1]
```

## Greedy

There isn't a need of caching the result, as all value with the interval with start `s_i` come before last end `e_(i-1)` is an overlap and need to be remove. These isn't any better case at all. So we can remove them, directly increase our result by  `1`
- Still sort every intervals by end value
- If start `s_i` overlap last `[...last_end]`, consider we remove this interval, `ans = ans + 1`, `last_end` is un-change as we not adding this interval in to result.  
- If start `s_i` not overlap, consider adding this current interval into our result and update the `last_end` value

Here is provided Answer from Leetcode
```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort(key = lambda x: x[1])
        ans = 0
        k = -inf
        
        for x, y in intervals:
            if x >= k:
                # Case 1
                k = y
            else:
                # Case 2
                ans += 1
        
        return ans
```
