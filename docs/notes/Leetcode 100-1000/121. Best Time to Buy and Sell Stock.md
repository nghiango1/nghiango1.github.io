# Problem

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

# Solve
- I already solve [[714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee|714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee]], still, it not quite the same.

## Brute force
(language:: python) (time:: O(n ** 2))

- A quick `n**2` answer
- Which don't care about how input `prices` work
    - We checking all possible buy time (which cost O(n) time)
    - each time, we find the best time to sell stock (which also cost  `O(n)` time)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(prices) == 1:
            return 0
        
        max_price = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(prices)):
                if max_price >= prices[j] - prices[i]:
                    continue
                max_price = prices[j] - prices[i]
        
        return max_price
```

## Optimizing
(language:: python) (time:: O(n))

- We can optimize this by try find the max price of `prices[i+1: len(prices)]` immediately. We could use a Dynamic programming for storing all Maximum value of `prices[i+1: len(prices)]`
```python
# TODO
```

Or calculating it on the fly in the same loop that checking all possible stock buy times.

In final implementation, I instead do a reverse job, where I checking all possible stock sell time (which between `[1 .. len(prices) - 1]`).
- For this case, we instead find min price or `prices[0: j]`. Keeping track of it in `curr_min_price` variable. 
- This just update the stock best `max_price` from 1 to n. Using this formula
    ```
    max_price = prices[index] - curr_min_price
    ```

Final implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(prices) == 1:
            return 0
        curr_min_price = prices[0] # keep track of the min of value price[0:index-1]
        max_price = 0
        for index, value in enumerate(prices):
            if index == 0:
                continue
            if max_price < prices[index] - curr_min_price:
                max_price = prices[index] - curr_min_price
            if curr_min_price > prices[index]:
                curr_min_price = prices[index]

        return max_price
```
