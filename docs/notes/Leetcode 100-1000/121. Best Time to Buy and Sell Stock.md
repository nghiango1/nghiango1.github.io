# Problem

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

# Solve
- I already solve [[714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee|714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee]], still, it not quite the same.

- Here is quick `n**2` answer
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(prices) == 1:
            return 0
        
        max_price = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(prices)):
                if max_price >= prices[j] - prices[i]:
                    continue
                max_price = prices[j] - prices[i]
        
        return max_price
```

- We can optimize this by try find the max price of  `prices[i+1: len(prices)]` immediately. 
```python
# TODO
```
- Or reversing it to file min price or `prices[0: j]` instead. Here is using more clear name
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(prices) == 1:
            return 0
        curr_min_price = prices[0] # keep track of the min of value price[0:index-1]
        max_price = 0
        for index, value in enumerate(prices):
            if index == 0:
                continue
            if max_price < prices[index] - curr_min_price:
                max_price = prices[index] - curr_min_price
            if curr_min_price > prices[index]:
                curr_min_price = prices[index]

        return max_price
```
