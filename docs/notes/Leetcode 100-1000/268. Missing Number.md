# Problem

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return _the only number in the range that is missing from the array._

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10**4`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the numbers of `nums` are **unique**.

**Example 1:**
```markdown
**Input:** nums = [3,0,1]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

## Bit manipulation
We can use `xor` to get needed information: 
- `Xor` two same number will return 0
- While `Xor` any number with 0 return it self

We already know `nums` array is range `[0..len(nums)]` with a missing number. By `xor` all available number in range `[0..len(nums)]` again, we effectively negative all exist number in `nums` array, leaving only one missing number left being `xor` with `0`.

Which mean, the sum `s` of `xor` all number is our needed result missing number

```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        s = 0
        for i, x in enumerate(nums):
            s = s ^ i ^ x
            
        s = s ^ len(nums)
        return s
```

Same implement in C
```c
int missingNumber(int* nums, int numsSize){
    int s = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < numsSize; i++) {
        s ^= i ^ nums[i];
    }

    s ^= numsSize;
    return s;
}
```

## Sort, Counting, Caching, Binary search tree...

Try to find missing number by checking all possible answer one by one:
- Loop through `nums` array, remember all found number
- Checking again in range `[0..len(number)]` and our chosen caching information from previous step to quickly separate: which number is in `nums` array, and which is the missing one

```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        isFound = [False] * (len(nums)+1)
        for x in nums:
            isFound[x] = True
        for i, f in enumerate(isFound):
            if not f:
                return i
        return len(nums)
```
