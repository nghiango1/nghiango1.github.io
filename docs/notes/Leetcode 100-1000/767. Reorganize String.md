# Problem

Given a string `s`, rearrange the characters of `s` so that any two adjacent characters are not the same.

Return _any possible rearrangement of_ `s` _or return_ `""` _if not possible_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "aab"
**Output:** "aba"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "aaab"
**Output:** ""

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 500`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

# Solve

## Recursion 
(language:: python)

I try no simulating the process of try and error. Where start from total array of character `s`. I put the char in a current `curr` array one by one, while maintain any two adjacent characters  in `curr` are not the same.

```python
class Solution:
    def helper(self, curr, remain):
        if len(remain) == 0:
            self.result = curr
            return True
        for i, c in enumerate(remain):
            if len(curr) > 0 and curr[-1] == c:
                continue
            if self.helper(curr+c, remain[:i] + remain[i+1:]):
                return True
        return False


    def reorganizeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        self.result = ""
        self.helper("", s)
        return self.result
```

## Greedy
(language:: python)

When analyzing the result more, I trying to chose the best way to put character `c` form remain character of `s` into `curr` array. 

So I come up with a greedy way to choose each element with this rule:
- Sort all element by total count
- Because all two adjacent element isn't the same. We start with highest total count element `x`, put it all into `curr` array
- The next loop, we push all other number one by one (from highest total count to lowest), separating all already pushed `x`. 
- If we success separating all `x` element, any remain character can be freely push into the array from by define.

I try some type of way to allocating memory, but it not that much affect the time complexity.

        count = [0]*27
        for i in s:

                res = c* count[nc]
                atleast = count[nc]
                continue

                if atleast == 0:
                    atleast = len(res)
                atleast = atleast -1
                res = res[:atleast] + c + res[atleast:]
        if len(res) > 1 and res[0] == res[1]:
            return ""
        return res
```

## JavaScript implementation
(language:: javascript) 

Normally, I won't use JavaScript in any calculation, algorithm and mostly to interact with html dom, html element, handle web data, JSON, .... So this is quite a new experience
- Array in JavaScript is similar to python, which is just a holder to any sequence of element (with no type enforce)
- We can pushing element into array by using `Array.splice`
- The equivalence JavaScript  `chr`, `ord`  function is `String.fromCodePoint()`  and `String.charCodeAt(0)`
- You can't forEach on string.
- We have `Array.sort()` which accept key function as two element as input. (python in the other hand only take one element)
