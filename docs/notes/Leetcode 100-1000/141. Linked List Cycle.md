# Problem

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)

**Input:** head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

# Solve

Keep tracked of any node that we have pass by a hashmap. If we step in a tracked node, then there is a cycle, and we can return `True`.

Return `False` if otherwise

```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        cache = set()
        p = head
        while p:
            if p in cache:
                return True
            cache.add(p)
            p = p.next

        return False 
```
