# Problem

Given an integer `columnNumber`, return _its corresponding column title as it appears in an Excel sheet_.

For example:
```sh
A -> 1
B -> 2
C -> 3
...
Z -> 26
AA -> 27
AB -> 28 
...
```
**Example 1:**

**Input:** columnNumber = 1
**Output:** "A"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** columnNumber = 28
**Output:** "AB"

**Example 3:**

**Input:** columnNumber = 701
**Output:** "ZY"

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= columnNumber <= 2**31 - 1`
# Solve

# Borrow/Memo number modification

Like [[171. Excel Sheet Column Number|171. Excel Sheet Column Number]], this problem is a special base 26 to base 10 problem. That has character set `["A", "B", ..., "Z" ]` with corresponds value `[1,2,3,4,...,26]`  (it's not including `0`)

To make this easier to understand:
- `"AB" = 27` can be presentation as `[1, 2]` (in special base 26)
- `"ZY" = 701` can be presentation as `[26, 25]` (in special base 26)
- `"Z" = 27` can be presentation as `[26]` (in special base 26)

```python
def convertBase26Without0():
    ## Need to implement
```

While in normal base 26 (with 0), we have:
- `"AB" = 27` can be presentation as `[1, 2]` (in normal base 26)
- `"ZY" = 701` can be presentation as `[1, 0, 25]` (in normal base 26)
- `"Z" = 26` can be presentation as `[1, 0]` (in normal base 26)

```python
def convertBase26():
    remain = columnNumber
    curr = 0
    nums = []
    while remain:
        curr = remain % 26
        remain = remain // 26
        nums.apppend(curr)
```

After a "quick" analyze, I come to this conclusion
- This work the same as normal base 26, just without `0`, instead, we have a new value `26`
- This mean, instead of normal base 26 using `10` or `[1, 0]` -> we write `Z` or `[26]` instead
- Which it self is a modification: _With any `0` we replace it with `26`, and minus the next number by `1`. Effectively to said that we are borrowing `26` value from the next number_

```python
class Solution:
    def convertToTitle(self, columnNumber: int) -> str:
        r = columnNumber
        c = 0
        v = []
        memo = 0
        while r > 26:
            c = r % 26 + memo
            r = r // 26
            memo = 0
            if c <= 0:
                memo = -1
                v.append(26+c)
            else:
                v.append(c)
        res = ""
        ord_a = ord("A") - 1
        if r + memo > 0:
            res += chr(r + ord_a + memo)
        for i in v[::-1]:
            if i == "0":
                continue
            res += chr(i + ord_a)
        return res
```
# Adding 1

> This work the same as normal base 26, just without `0`, instead, we have a new value `26`

A more nature take is that we adding 1 for every number after modification, this can be achieve by taking `1` value from the `remain` and add it to `curr`

```python
class Solution:
    def convertToTitle(self, columnNumber: int) -> str:
        remain = columnNumber
        curr = 0
        ord_subA = ord("A") - 1
        res = ""
        while remain >= 26:
            curr = (remain - 1) % 26 + 1
            remain = (remain - 1) // 26
            res = chr(curr + ord_subA) + res
            
        if remain > 0:
            res = chr(remain + ord_subA) + res
        return res
```

By take a look at the best implementation, which done the same thing, just more compact:

```python
class Solution:
    def convertToTitle(self, columnNumber: int) -> str:
        out = ''
        while columnNumber != 0:
            out = chr(ord('A') + (columnNumber - 1) % 26) + out
            columnNumber = (columnNumber - 1) // 26
        return out
```


## C implementation
(language:: c)

To prepare for creating `char *` (using `maloc`), we want to create a big enough char array, which need to be pre calculating.

So I just create a big enough memory size in stack, process the problem. Then re-copy the result's value one by one to the heap allocation variable, already knowing it length and return.

As string in c is `char[]` or `char *` with `NULL` at end. I make sure to put `NULL` or `00000000` into the last element of the result `title`

    title[length] = NULL;
    
    for (int i = length - 1; i >= 0; i --) {
