# Problem

You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `ith` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return _the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** cost = [10,15,20]
**Output:** 15
**Explanation:** You will start at index 1.
- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
The total cost is 15.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** You will start at index 0.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
The total cost is 6.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= cost.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= cost[i] <= 999`

# Solve

## White board

Quick glance on the problem give me a fell of "this is a Dynamic programming"

Now I need to find a [[Recursive formulation|Recursive formulation]]:
- I first thought on that we storing the answer of all child problem in the memory

### First approach: Storing the answer directly 

```
cost = [10,15,20]

And we try to create
res  = [10,10,15]
```

When reading the problem description, and needed answer, I set up the baseline answer with

```
res[0] := cost[0]
res[1] := min(cost[1], cost[0])
```

Now how to get 15 in `res[2]`, I try

```
res[2] = min(res[1], c + res[0])
```

This is base on observation that:
- To go to index 2 i first need to go to index 0 or 1
- If i get to index 2, ... < This is where I found out a really trouble some of my first approarch >

By some quick analyse, I found out a big hole in my first attempt:
- When we get to res[0] or res[1], it unsure we needed to buy index 0 or index 1 or not, making it not possible to know if we need to buy either of them to get to res[2]
- This mean I need more stage value on how can I get to res[0] or res[1]

> By more deeply thought, I believe I got it wrong on my res value which need to be `res = [0,0,15]` and not `res = [10,10,15]`.
> 
> This could still be a possible approach. 
### Second approach: Storing staged value only.

Using the first approach end analysis, I quick change to a staged result only. I attempt on storing value that is smallest total that I can jump to and buy the current index spot.

```
cost  = [10, 15, 20]

total = [10, 15, 30]
```

Base value

```
total[0] = cost[0]
total[1] = cost[1]
```

Formula

```
total[2] = cost[2] + min(total[0], total[1])
```

- We always buy the current spot, so cost[2] need to be added
- To jump to index 2, we at least need to stand at index 0 or index 1 step. So `min(total[0], total[1])` will set us up at the right position to jump to step 2 at minimal total price.

Our answer, will either be at the last step or previous of last step of the staircase.

```
res = min(total[last_step], total[last_step-1])
```

Quick implementation in (language:: python)

```python
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        total = []
        for c in cost:
            if len(total) == 0:
                total.append(c)
                continue
            if len(total) == 1:
                total.append(c)
                continue
            total.append(c + min(total[-2], total[-1]))
        print(total)
        return min(total[-1], total[-2])
```

### Testing the code

Trying this code on some input result:

Example 1:

```
cost  = [10, 15, 20]
total = [10, 15, 30]
res   = 15
```

Example 2:

```
cost  = [1, 100, 1, 1, 1, 100, 1, 1, 100, 1]
total = [1, 100, 2, 3, 3, 103, 4, 5, 104, 6]
res   = 6
```

Hand create test case:

```
cost = [10,15,20,5 , 2, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 7, 8, 9,21, 3,574, 9, 2,321, 8, 9]
total= [10,15,30,20,22,22,25,29,33,38,40,46,49,67,52,626,61,63,382,71,80]
res  = 71
```

It seem that it do exactly what I describing approach.

I submit it directly into Leetcode which return 

Runtime: 57 ms Beats: 79.52%
Memory: 16.4 MB Beats: 78.37%

## Implementation: DP - Storing staged value
(language:: go)
(time:: O(n))

- Knowing the answer, i implementing it in go language for better performance, also using only 2 variable as  we only need two most recently used value of the `total` array in our quick draft `python` code

```go
func min(a int,b int) int {
    if a < b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}

func minCostClimbingStairs(cost []int) int {
    a := cost[0]
    b := cost[1]
    for i := 2; i < len(cost); i ++ {
        if i%2 == 0 {
            a = cost[i] + min(a,b)
        } else {
            b = cost[i] + min(a,b)
        }
    }

    return min(a,b)
}
```

The final result is:
- Runtime 6ms (Beats 14.00% of users with Go)
- Memory 2.84MB (Beats 79.74%of users with Go)
