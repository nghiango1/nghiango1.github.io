# Problem

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

**Note:**

- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). Therefore, in **Example 2** above, the input represents the signed integer `-3` and the output represents the signed integer `-1073741825`.

**Constraints:**

- The input must be a **binary string** of length `32`

**Example 1:**
```markdown
**Input:** n = 00000010100101000001111010011100
**Output:**    964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)
**Explanation:** The input binary string **00000010100101000001111010011100** represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is **00111001011110000010100101000000**.
```

Here is what i done:
- Turn number `n` to binary string using `bin(n)`
- Padding `0` to get enough 32 bit, by adding `(1<<32)` and remove first bit of the string `bin(n)` (And `0b` string from the result, which in total is 3 character)
- Revert the product string using `[::-1]`
- And finally turn the revert binary string back to number using `int(<binary_string>, base=2)` 
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:
        return int(bin(n + (1<<32))[3:][::-1], base=2)
```

Or just simple adding it bit by bit, using binary manipulation
```c
uint32_t reverseBits(uint32_t n) {
    uint32_t r_num = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
        r_num <<= 1; //r_num = r_num * 2
        r_num += (n >> i) & 1; // r_num = r_num + n[32-i] 
    }
    return r_num;
}
```
