# Problem

Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it **loops endlessly in a cycle** which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1** are happy.

Return `true` _if_ `n` _is a happy number, and_ `false` _if not_.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 2**31 - 1`

**Example 1:**

```markdown
**Input:** n = 19
**Output:** true
**Explanation:**
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```

# Solve

Loop until n == 1. No cycle found return `True`
If we found a cycle, return `False`

We can stored visited node into a hash map to check cycle

```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        visited = set()
        while n != 1:
            if n in visited:
                return False
            visited.add(n)
            m = 0
            tmp = n
            while tmp:
                m += (tmp % 10) ** 2
                tmp = tmp // 10
            n = m
        return True
```
