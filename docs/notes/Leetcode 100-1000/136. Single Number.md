# Problem

Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears _twice_ except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**
```markdown
**Input:** nums = [2,2,1]
**Output:** 1
```

# Solve
- Using binary `xor` (`^` operation in python), we can nullify any two time appear number  
- The remaining is the needed answer

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        a_number = 0
        for n in nums:
            a_number ^= n
        
        return a_number
```
