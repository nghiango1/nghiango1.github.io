# Problem

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return _an array of their intersection_. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in **any order**.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`

**Example 1:**
```markdown
**Input:** nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
**Output:** [2,2]
```

# Solve
I do exactly this:
- Count all number of both array
- Find intersect number value (don't care about duplicate)
- Rebuild result array using needed information: `<Total time appear both nums> * [value]`

```python
class Solution(object):
    def intersect(self, nums1, nums2):
        interset = set(nums1).intersection(set(nums2))
        count = {}
        for i in nums1:
            if i not in count:
                count[i] = [0, 0]
            count[i][0] += 1
        
        for i in nums2:
            if i not in count:
                count[i] = [0, 0]
            count[i][1] += 1
        
        result = []
        for key in interset:
            result += min(count[key])* [key]
        return result
```

## Counting, using a large predefined array

I need more time to done the same with C, as C not have good hash map for set() available from the language standard library at all, we using fully the provided Constant:
- Count all the number appear on `nums1` and `nums2`, storing in a predefined array that cover all possible number. Which is  `[0..1000] `(as `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`)
- Build up the intersection by going through all possible number, by using the same logic:
    - If our current number `i` appear on both, adding that `i` to the  `intersectArr` for the total `occur = min(count1[i], count2[i])` times
    - If it not appear `occur = 0`, go to the next number

Now to the "slow" part, why it slow? Because I need to check:
- The return type is `int*`, which is a persistence memory in heap, while our `intersectArr` is allocating inside a [[C local function scope|C local function scope]], which being clear/disappear after going back to main function. So, we need to `malloc` new memory and transfer `intersectArr` over one by one. 
- The `int* returnSize`, this is where we have to return the length or our `result`. It quite confusion as `returnSize` is a pointer (which why using `printf("%d", returnSize)` output some thing like `91267892`). We need to know syntax to correctly pass the required value to  `returnSize`, which is `*returnSize = intersectArrLen`.

```c
/**
 * Note: The returned array must be malloced, assume caller calls free().
 */
int* intersect(int* nums1, int nums1Size, int* nums2, int nums2Size, int* returnSize){
    int* result;
    
    int count1[1005] = {0};
    int count2[1005] = {0};
    int intersectArr[1005] = {0};
    int intersectArrLen = 0;
    int occur = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums1Size; i++) count1[nums1[i]] ++;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums2Size; i++) count2[nums2[i]] ++;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 1001; i++){
        occur = count1[i];
        if (count1[i] > count2[i]) occur = count2[i];
        for (int _j = 0; _j < occur; _j ++) {
            intersectArr[intersectArrLen] = i;
            intersectArrLen ++;
        }
    }
    
    result = (int*)malloc(intersectArrLen * sizeof(int));
    for (int i = 0; i < intersectArrLen; i++){
        result[i] = intersectArr[i];
    }
    
    *returnSize = intersectArrLen;
    return result;
}
```
