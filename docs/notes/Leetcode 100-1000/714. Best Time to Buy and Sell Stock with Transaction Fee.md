# Problem

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

**Note:**

- You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
- The transaction fee is only charged once for each stock purchase and sale.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** The maximum profit can be achieved by:
- Buying at prices[0] = 1
- Selling at prices[3] = 8
- Buying at prices[4] = 4
- Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.

# Solve

I track the profit I can make the most of when I:
- Not holding any stock `bestProfit[0]`
- Holding a stock `bestProfit[1]`

With each step of prices change:

- If I don't want to holding stock in this step, my `bestProfit[0]` is affect by two case:
	- I could try to sell my currently holding stock `last_bestProfit[1]` and get `last_bestProfit[1] + price - fee` asset value 
	- or I could do not thing and keep `last_bestProfit[0]` asset value

- If I want to holding a stock now, my `bestProfit[1]` is also affect by two case: 
	- I could try to buy a stock, which make my asset value down to  `last_bestProfit[0] - price` 
	- or I could doing any thing and keep `last_bestProfit[1]`

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:
        bestProfit = [0, 0]
        for step, price in enumerate(prices):
            if step == 0:
                bestProfit[1] = -price
                continue
            tmp = bestProfit[0]
            bestProfit[0] = max(bestProfit[0], bestProfit[1] + price - fee)
            bestProfit[1] = max(bestProfit[1], tmp - price)
        return bestProfit[0]

```
