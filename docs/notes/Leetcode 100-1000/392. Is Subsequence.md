# Problem

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if_ `s` _is a **subsequence** of_ `t`_, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 100`
- `0 <= t.length <= 10**4`
- `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Suppose there are lots of incoming `s`, say `s1, s2, ..., sk` where `k >= 10**9`, and you want to check one by one to see if `t` has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

# Solve

## Find s in t using a straight line Trie-tree
(language:: python) (time:: O(n))

I like the follow up question, we create a Trie tree using all possible s (s1, s2, ..., sk) that need to be check.

But we only have one `s` here, so the Trie tree from all possible s is a single one line tree.

Let set some number:
- m = t.length
- n = s.length

With out any follow up, this cost O(m) time in worst case

> For follow up time complexity, we cost:
> - O(k * n) to create Trie-tree for all possible S
> - A query to find all s1,s2 ... sk is in t could cost us a traversal cost O(length t)  + update tree cost O(all tree node) <= O(k * n)
> - So overall we could reach O(k * n) + O(m) time complexity 

> But k = 10 ** 9 ? So we dealing with a 100_000_000_000 low case English character input ~ 100 GB of input here. `O(k * n)` isn't a great solution at all 

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    x = 0
    i = 0

    while x < len(s) and i < len(t):
        if t[i] == s[x]:
        x += 1
        i += 1

    return x == len(s)
```

## Trie-tree using t

### Normal Trie-tree

If we in the case that s is random, we couldn't create Trie-tree on `s` at all.
This mean, a normal approach is that we preprocess `t` to a Trie-tree to quickly traversing and finding s.

Now look at `0 <= t.length <= 10 ** 4`. This Trie-tree could support `0 <= s.length <= 100`, which mean it only need 100 node deep. Also, `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters. We could possibility reach $27^{100}$ possible node for our t Trie-tree.

So, is there a way for this Trie-tree to happened in a limited memory? We have some calculation here

- Assuming we have a maximum input with t = repeat("qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm", $\frac{10^4}{27} = 370$) , which make it possible to have all 100 combination of low case English letter
- I could try bitmask to contain 27 letter in a 32 bit variable. But we still deal with nested 100 times number here, making it 32 ** 100 bit length variable =  4 ** 100 byte length ~ 1.60693804E60 byte
- So not that much possible route, unless we have $10^{36}$ 1 Yobibyte hard drive ![[Pasted image 20230922220121.png|Pasted image 20230922220121.png]]

### But wait, we could use a more friendly pre-calculated search table

#### White board

![[Pasted image 20230922220626.png|Pasted image 20230922220626.png]]

On each position, we could have a jump table that point us to the closest position that have corresponded character in t array.

- This way, start from t = 1, we can quickly jump to next position without spending much time in traversal.
- The memory cost is just O(n) or in real number 27 * n memory, which is a possible number.

### Implementation - Still with a single s
(language:: python) (time:: O(n))

- For easy of mind, I use a `dict` here (as we use python). For other language it better a array using char byte code or some "map" implementation for lower memory usage.
- The jumpTable create process can be push out side and only need to be created once. In fact here is the first implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    jumpTable = [0] * (len(t)+1)
    jumpTable[len(t)] = {}

    for index in range(len(t)-1,-1,-1):
        c = t[index]
        jumpTable[index] = jumpTable[index+1].copy()
        jumpTable[index][c] = index + 1

    index = 0

    for c in s:
        if c in jumpTable[index]:
        index = jumpTable[index][c]
        else:
        return False

    return True
```

Here is a cached one, this have a O(m * total test case) space and O(m) time complexity. But if we hit cache, this cost us O(n) to process any `s` string

```python
class Solution:

    def __init__(self):
    self.cache = {}

    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    if t in self.cache:
        jumpTable = self.cache[t]
    else:
        jumpTable = [0] * (len(t)+1)
        jumpTable[len(t)] = {}

        for index in range(len(t)-1,-1,-1):
        c = t[index]
        jumpTable[index] = jumpTable[index+1].copy()
        jumpTable[index][c] = index + 1

    index = 0
    for c in s:
        if c in jumpTable[index]:
        index = jumpTable[index][c]
        else:
        return False

    return True
```

> For the follow up, if we hit cache every time with t, then this is a O(k * n) time complexity  

## Is there a possible under 1s instance answer for the follow up

### Sample take on how big our data is

![[Pasted image 20230923000851.png|Pasted image 20230923000851.png]]

I try to recreating the Follow up problem using random in go

- The generation it self take for ever ~ 100GB data. Our program take ~ 1_000_000 `isSubsequence` on a random `s` with same `t` already cost us ~ 2s.
- This mean it at least take 2 * 100 ~ 200s (without any thing about actual time to real all the data from a hard drive (we are cheating using random here, as every thing happen on RAM, which is way better ?? could be not)

```go

    sol.mu.Unlock()

    if sol.cache == nil {

        var jumpTable []([27]int)
        jumpTable = make([]([27]int), len(t)+1)
        for j := 0; j < 27; j++ {
            jumpTable[len(t)][j] = -1

            idx = jumpTable[idx][c]
        } else {
            return false
        }

    return true

### Optimizing 1 - Thread/Goroutine/Multi-core distributed computing

I think we isn't find an possible solution here, but, at least we can make it faster using parallels thread on multi core CPU (I have 8 core in my VM).
- We only need to create one jumpTable
- jumpTable remain unchanged, we only need to read jumpTable in each input `s`
- This make it possible for multi thread accessing `jumpTable` as a constant read memory.

```
# To do
```

### Optimizing 2 - O(Log(n)) for finding S

### Optimizing 3 - O(1) for finding S ???
