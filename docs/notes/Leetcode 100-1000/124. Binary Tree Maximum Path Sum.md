# Problem

A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the maximum **path sum** of any **non-empty** path_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/exx1.jpg)

**Input:** root = [1,2,3]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/exx2.jpg)

**Input:** root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
**Output:** 42
**Explanation:** The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3 * 104]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

# Solve
## Dynamic programming on Tree

I hate it when I can't control how `TreeNode` work, my first approach to to populate all `TreeNode` with it `maxPath` (the max value of path that contain its self as the end node).

We calculate base on this formula:
- `maxPath(root) = Max(0, root.val) + max(maxPath(left), maxPath(right))`

After that, we try to find the Maximum Path Sum by checking all possible `TreeNode`
- `maxPathSum(root) = pathOnlyIn(Root) = max(pathOnlyIn(Left) , pathOnlyIn(Right) , pathGoTrough(Root))` 
- `pathGoTrough(Root) = maxPath(left) + maxPath(right) + root.val`
- `pathOnlyIn(None) = 0`
- `pathGoTrough(None) = Not define`

But, I can't just adding the `left.maxPath`, `right.maxPath`; so here is the code that combining both in one loop 
```python
class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        def helper(root):
            if root is None:
                return 0, -100000
            
            maxLeftPath, onlyLeftMax = helper(root.left)
            maxRightPath, onlyRightMax = helper(root.right)
            
            maxRootPath = max(root.val, root.val + max(maxLeftPath, maxRightPath))
            
            onlyRootMax = root.val + max(0, maxLeftPath) + max(0, maxRightPath)
            
            maxPathSum = max(onlyLeftMax, onlyRightMax, onlyRootMax)
            
            return maxRootPath, maxPathSum
        
        _, maxPathSum = helper(root) 
        
        return maxPathSum
```
