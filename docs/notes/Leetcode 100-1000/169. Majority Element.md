# Problem

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return _the majority element_.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 104`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

>**Follow-up:** Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space?

**Example 1:**
```markdown
**Input:** nums = [3,2,3]
**Output:** 3
```

# Solve
Let quickly settle this with a hash map counting cache array, ideally with built-in implementation `dict()` or `{}` in python

```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums_count = {}
        for n in nums:
            if n not in nums_count:
                nums_count[n] = 0
            nums_count[n] += 1
            if nums_count[n] > len(nums)//2:
                return n
        return "Some thing isn't right"
```

A better that using lower memory is using quicksort and return the value of middle `n//2` index element 
```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        return nums[n//2]
```

## Follow up madness

Here is the `Crtl + C` code:
```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        confident = 0
        majority_number = None
        for current_number in nums:
            if confident == 0:
                majority_number = current_number
            if current_number == majority_number:
	            confident += 1 
            else:
                confident -= 1
        return majority_number
```

- You assuming any number to be the `majority_number`. 
- With each loop through all available number in `nums` array we check our `confident` level
	- If it appear again: raise our `confident` by 1
	- Else reducing it by 1
	- When `confident = 0`, we try change our `majority_number`
- Return `majority_number` after

## Compare?
Barely notice-able different, the input really easy on us. Unless we using a compiler, a interpreter language like `python` does not provide good enough information on which faster
