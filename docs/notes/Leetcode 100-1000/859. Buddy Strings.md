# Problem

Given two strings `s` and `goal`, return `true` _if you can swap two letters in_ `s` _so the result is equal to_ `goal`_, otherwise, return_ `false`_._

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices `i` and `j` (0-indexed) such that `i != j` and swapping the characters at `s[i]` and `s[j]`.

- For example, swapping at indices `0` and `2` in `"abcd"` results in `"cbad"`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 2 * 10**4`
- `s` and `goal` consist of lowercase letters.

# Solve
## Read the problem
- Only one swap is allow, and we get two identical string

## Analysis
- The constrain is really low
- There should be two case that return `True`, which is: ***1.*** String `s` and `goal` have no different, we swap an identical character so the string remain unchanged; ***2.*** String `s` and `goal` have a pair `(x,y)` being swap

## Code it
- Just a regular loop through all character of `pair(s, goal)` check to find if there is any different character. Storing their position in `diff` array
- If `len(s) > len(goal)` or `len(diff) != 0 and len(diff) != 2` then we can just return `False`
- For case ***1.*** `len(diff) == 0` we can loop through string `s` and find if any character is repeat (using `set()` to keep track which char have show up). Return `True` if found or `False` if not
- For case ***2.*** `len(diff) == 2` we can quick check if swapping 2 character with position `diff[0], diff[1]` of either `s` or `goal` is equal to the other one or not: Using `s[diff[1]] == goal[diff[0]] and s[diff[0]] == goal[diff[1]]`


## Implement
```python
class Solution:
    def buddyStrings(self, s: str, goal: str) -> bool:
        # Find different of s and goal
        if len(s) != len(goal):
            return False

        diff = []
        for i, (x, y) in enumerate(zip(s, goal)):
            if x != y:
                diff.append(i)

        if len(diff) != 0 and len(diff) != 2:
            return False

        if len(diff) == 2:
            return s[diff[1]] == goal[diff[0]] and s[diff[0]] == goal[diff[1]]

        check = set()
        for c in s:
            if c not in check:
                check.add(c)
            else:
                return True
        return False
```
