# Problem

Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, _capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by_ `'X'`.

A region is **captured** by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/xogrid.jpg)

**Input:** board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"|"X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
**Output:** [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"|"X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
**Explanation:** Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = [["X"|"X"]]
**Output:** [["X"|"X"]]

**Constraints:**

- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.

# Solve

## Simulation BFS
Just focus on the rule in the example: 

an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.

So I check all the border for `'O'`. Adding them all to a queue, and start do a BFS on all of them to find if any Adj cell is also `'O'`.

After visiting all `'O'` that we should not flip (Which being track with our visited array `v`), flipping all other remain one.

```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        m = len(board)
        n = len(board[0])
        q = []
        v = set()
        for i in range(n):
            if board[0][i] == 'O':
                q.append((0, i))
            v.add((0, i))
            if board[m - 1][i] == 'O':
                q.append((m - 1, i))
            v.add((m - 1, i))
            
        for i in range(m):
            if (i,0) not in v:
                if board[i][0]  == 'O':
                    q.append((i, 0))
                v.add((i, 0))
            if (i, n - 1) not in v:
                if board[i][n - 1]  == 'O':
                    q.append((i, n- 1))
                v.add((i, n - 1))
            
        while len(q) > 0:
            x, y = q.pop(0)
            for nx, ny in [(x-1, y), (x+1, y), (x, y-1), (x, y+1)]:
                if not (0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n):
                    continue
                if (nx,ny) in v:
                    continue
                v.add((nx,ny))
                if board[nx][ny] == 'O':
                    q.append((nx,ny))
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if (i, j) not in v:
                    board[i][j] = 'X'
```
