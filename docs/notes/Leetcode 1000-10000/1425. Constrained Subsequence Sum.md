# Problem

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum sum of a **non-empty** subsequence of that array such that for every two **consecutive** integers in the subsequence, `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, where `i < j`, the condition `j - i <= k` is satisfied.

A _subsequence_ of an array is obtained by deleting some number of elements (can be zero) from the array, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = `[10,2,-10,5,20]`, k = 2
**Output:** 37
**Explanation:** The subsequence is `[10, 2, 5, 20]`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = `[-1,-2,-3]`, k = 1
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** The subsequence must be non-empty, so we choose the largest number.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = `[10,-2,-10,-5,20]`, k = 2
**Output:** 23
**Explanation:** The subsequence is `[10, -2, -5, 20]`.

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= `k` <= `nums.length` <= $10^5$
- $10^4$ <= `nums[i]` <= $10^4$

# Solve

## White board

### Problem explained

The problem have a really unclear description, so it take me quite some time to understands it. (Mainly because that I don't understand the word two **consecutive** integers)

With every 2 element of the subarray that next to each other, their main array position gap should not be large than `k` 

Let assume that we working with 0-index array here (it not being specify by the problem description, but not affect the actual problem) 
Example:

With this input: That have each element have their value is equal to their position in the main array for better graph on the problem
```
nums = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
k    = 2
```

We have subsequences array that match the description:
```
sub = [0, 2, 4, 6] (Each have 2 gap, which we have 2 <= k so it a match)
sub = [1, 2] (They only have 1 gap)
sub = [9] (A single character is alway accept)
```

While this one doesn't:
```
sub = [] (It empty)
sub = [6, 9] (The gap is large than 2)
```

### Trying to solve the problem

This look like a Dynamic programming problem, and could be a try all possible subsequence. I will try and look for [[Recursive formulation|Recursive formulation]] that cover all possible case.

To do this, first I need to check on the first base line that stop the formulation, which we have:

> 1 <= `k` <= `nums.length`

A `nums` array with length equal to 1, making the only possible array to choose should be `subarray = res = nums`

```python
res[0] = nums[0]
```

After that, we can keep going and try `nums.length = 2`. Assumingly that we already have some intonation after calculating `nums.length = 1`

```python
subarray in [
    [ nums[0], nums[1] ],
    [ nums[0] ],  # <- last res
    [ nums[1] ]
]
```

```python
res[1] = max(subarray) = max(last_res, additional_case)

additional_case = [
    [ nums[0], nums[1] ], # <- last_res[0] + nums[1]
    [ nums[1] ]  # <- last_res[-1] (empty) + nums[1] or just a started of subarray
]
```

So, this could possible a formulation. A for loop on all known result to add to a new number, or start a new one directly in place. Every result of `nums.length` (the highest possible sum of subarrays) is stored in `res` array.

Also, I want to add `k` to ensure the subarray is a match with our description. To make it easier, I enforce that `res[i]` will always have to have the current index `i` element in that subarray. This making that `res[i+k]` can always connect to `res[i:i+k]` stored subarrays.

> This also mean final result will need to be the maximum of the `res` array. Which are done covering all possible case of the problem.

Which make our final implementation look like this

```python
for i in range(n):
    # We have a possible answer that start a new subarray at current position
    res[i] = nums[i] 
    # We check all possible connection
    for j in range(max(0, i-k),i): 
        # nums[i] always being chose for current res
        res[i] = max(res[j] + nums[i]) 
```

Now let check with the real number:

> **Example 1:**
> 
> **Input:** nums = `[10,2,-10,5,20]`, k = 2
> **Output:** 37
> **Explanation:** The subsequence is `[10, 2, 5, 20]`.

We have quick result number should be:

```
res[0] = 10
res[1] = 12
res[2] = 2
res[3] = 17
res[4] = 37
```

Running our above implementation directly, here is the finished draft implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def constrainedSubsetSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        res = []
        for i in range(n):
            res.append(nums[i])
            for j in range(max(i-k, 0), i):
                res[i] = max(res[i], res[j] + nums[i])
        print(res) # <- debug print
        return max(res)
```

Final `test.py` file:

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def constrainedSubsetSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        res = []
        for i in range(n):
            res.append(nums[i])
            print(i, "=====")
            for j in range(max(i-k, 0), i):
                print(j) # <- This to make sure I have done process possible case
                res[i] = max(res[i], res[j] + nums[i])
        print(res) # <- debug print
        return max(res)


nums = [10,2,-10,5,20]
k = 2

a = Solution()
print("res = ", a.constrainedSubsetSum(nums, k))
```

Output seem great

```
0 =====
1 =====
0
2 =====
0
1
3 =====
1
2
4 =====
2
3
[10, 12, 2, 17, 37]
res =  37
```

Let summit this.

### Optimization process

Okay, after quick look on the total number we working on, It clear that our current O($N^2$) can't finish  the `k` <= `nums.length` <= $10^5$ solution.

So I need some further optimization. Let try to come up with ideal:
- We working to find with the max value on the second (nested) for loop always
- This mean we could directly store the value
- But the range is changing and some of value need to be remove. Which mean we should utilized a data structure that support remove element while keeping the max value easily accessible

The first thing in my mind is a Heap. More persistency is a Array implement of heap:
- Which we can remove any element in heap by pushing any number it into the last element 
- Then replacing it with new value we needed to push it in and update that value again
- This way, We keep the heap intact, remove old and add a new element into heap in O($log(n)$) time 

This making us possible to remove the nested loop, and reduce our current answer into O($n \cdot \log(n)$) time complexity.

Implementing heap is possible, but we can use `heapq` packaged, a built-in one, supported by python that have two function we need.
- `heappush`: Push new element
- `heapreplace`: Replace a existed element in the heap

> Actually, `heapreplace` only support root a of heap replacing, also there isn't any usable for deletion, so I have to implement it my own. But before that, is there any other data structure that support this.

After some check on my memory, here is heap implementation

```python
class Heap:
    def __init__(self, k):
        self.queue = []
        self.heap = []
        self.length = 0
        self.cap = k

    def push(self, x):
        needPrune = self.length > self.cap
        self.queue.pop(0)
        self.queue.append(x)
        if not needPrune:
            # import heapq
            self._push(n)
        else:
            self._
```
