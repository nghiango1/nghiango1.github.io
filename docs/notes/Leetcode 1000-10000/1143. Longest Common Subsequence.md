# Problem

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return _the length of their longest **common subsequence**._ If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

- For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** `text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" `
**Output:** `3`
**Explanation:** `The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.`

**Example 2:**

**Input:** `text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"`
**Output:** `3`
**Explanation:** `The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.`

**Example 3:**

**Input:** `text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"`
**Output:** `0`
**Explanation:** `There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.`

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`
- `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English characters.


# Solve
A dynamic program problem, which leverage the information of pre-solve value

```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        dp = [[0]*len(text2) for _ in text1]
        
        for i, c1 in enumerate(text1):
            for j, c2 in enumerate(text2):
                possible_answer = []
                
                if i > 0:
                    possible_answer.append(dp[i-1][j])
                if j > 0:
                    possible_answer.append(dp[i][j-1])
                    
                if c1 == c2:
                    if i > 0 and j > 0:
                        possible_answer.append(dp[i-1][j-1] + 1)
                    else:
                        possible_answer.append(1)
                if len(possible_answer) > 0:
                    dp[i][j] = max(possible_answer)
                
        return dp[len(text1)-1][len(text2)-1]
