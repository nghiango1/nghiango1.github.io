# Problem

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `x`. In one operation, you can either remove the leftmost or the rightmost element from the array `nums` and subtract its value from `x`. Note that this **modifies** the array for future operations.

Return _the **minimum number** of operations to reduce_ `x` _to **exactly**_ `0` _if it is possible__, otherwise, return_ `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,1,4,2,3], x = 5
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The optimal solution is to remove the last two elements to reduce x to zero.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [5,6,7,8,9], x = 4
**Output:** -1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [3,2,20,1,1,3], x = 10
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The optimal solution is to remove the last three elements and the first two elements (5 operations in total) to reduce x to zero.

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= `nums.length` <= $10^5$
- 1 <= `nums[i]` <= $10^4$
- 1 <= `x` <= $10^9$

- We can describe `x = sum(nums[0:left]) + sum(nums[right:n])` where `(left + n-right)` is minimum
- The ideal is that, there is a middle point to use binary search:
    - By trying each `left` (making `left` and `sum(nums[0:left])` constant on each loop) , we have a remain `sum(nums[right:n]) = x - sum[:left]` to full fill
    - With `right` travel between `[left .. n]` (no overlapping). We always have
    - `sum(nums[left:n]) < sum(nums[left+1:n]) < .. < sum(nums[n:n]) = 0` (as 1 <= $nums_i$ <= $10^4$).
    - We need to find a `sum(nums[right:n]) = x - sum[:left]` inside a sorted array, making it become a binary search problem
- This mean, we need a way to easily calculating `sum(nums[x:n])`, which is quite easy and can be stored in a O(n) space array.

## Build-in python - Binary search + Preprocessing Sum range
(language:: python) (time:: O(n log n))

I instead making right a static, and find left using binary search

- I pre-calculating all range `nums[0:0]`, `nums[0:1]`, ... , `nums[0:n]` (`n = len(nums)`) and storing them in `sumRange` array.

- We have some built-in binary search, which I used here `bisect_right`: `bisect_right` return a `position` where `sumRange[:position] <= x < sumRange[:position+1]`on a sorted array, args `hi = right+1` is there to force result not cause a overlapping. Using `help(bisect.bisect_right)` for the explanation

Final implementation is here:

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], x: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        sumRange = [0] * (n + 1)

        for i in range(n):
            sumRange[i+1] = sumRange[i] + nums[i]

        def getSum(x,y):
            return sumRange[y] - sumRange[x]
        
        minOps = n + 1
        for right in range(n, -1, -1):
            rightSum = getSum(right, n)
            leftSum = x - rightSum
            insertPos = bisect_right(sumRange, leftSum, hi = right+1)
            # print(sumRange[insertPos-1] - leftSum, insertPos, right)
            if sumRange[insertPos-1] == leftSum:
                possible = insertPos-1 + n - right
                if minOps > possible:
                    minOps = possible
                # print(possible)
        # print(n + 1)
        if minOps != n + 1:
            return minOps
        return -1
```

## Linear finding?
(language:: python) (time:: O(n))

We are sure that, `rightSum` is always increasing, which mean, `leftSum` always decreasing, which mean  `left` is always decreasing.

We now instead have a sliding window like problem (but revert - sum outsize vs sum inside, not that much of a different here)
- Every right increasing, left is sliding until sum equal smaller than `x`
- This making we, need to increasing right.
- Record every sliding window hit where sum = `x`, update minimum value

Left and right loop only travel in one direction and is independent, making this a O(n) times complexity
- Still, I use a binary search for the first init value.
- In fact, If I remove all together `sumRange` and all in on sliding window, we could get O(1) in space, which is optimal solution I can get from this approach

Final implementation:


```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], x: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        sumRange = [0] * (n + 1)

        for i in range(n):
            sumRange[i+1] = sumRange[i] + nums[i]

        def getSum(x,y):
            return sumRange[y] - sumRange[x]
        
        minOps = n + 1
        insertPos = -1
        for right in range(n, -1, -1):
            rightSum = getSum(right, n)
            leftSum = x - rightSum
            if insertPos == -1:
                insertPos = bisect_right(sumRange, leftSum, hi = right+1)
            else:
                while insertPos > 0:
                    if sumRange[insertPos-1] <= leftSum:
                        break
                    insertPos -= 1
            # print(sumRange[insertPos-1] - leftSum, insertPos, right)
            if sumRange[insertPos-1] == leftSum:
                possible = insertPos-1 + n - right
                if minOps > possible:
                    minOps = possible
                # print(possible)
        # print(n + 1)
        if minOps != n + 1:
            return minOps
        return -1
```
