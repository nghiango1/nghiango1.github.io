# Problem

There is a one-dimensional garden on the x-axis. The garden starts at the point `0` and ends at the point `n`. (i.e The length of the garden is `n`).

There are `n + 1` taps located at points `[0, 1, ..., n]` in the garden.

Given an integer `n` and an integer array `ranges` of length `n + 1` where `ranges[i]` (0-indexed) means the `i-th` tap can water the area `[i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]]` if it was open.

Return _the minimum number of taps_ that should be open to water the whole garden, If the garden cannot be watered return **-1**.

**Example 1:**

![[Pasted image 20230831091225.png|Pasted image 20230831091225.png]]

**Input:** n = 5, ranges = [3,4,1,1,0,0]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The tap at point 0 can cover the interval [-3,3]
The tap at point 1 can cover the interval [-3,5]
The tap at point 2 can cover the interval [1,3]
The tap at point 3 can cover the interval [2,4]
The tap at point 4 can cover the interval [4,4]
The tap at point 5 can cover the interval [5,5]
Opening Only the second tap will water the whole garden [0,5]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, ranges = [0,0,0,0]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** Even if you activate all the four taps you cannot water the whole garden.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10 ** 4`
- `ranges.length == n + 1`
- `0 <= ranges[i] <= 100`

# Solve

![[1326. White Board - Minimum Number of Taps to Open to Water a Garden.canvas|1326. White Board - Minimum Number of Taps to Open to Water a Garden]]
- We can greedy choosing the best possible tap every step (which covered the most range possible)
- This can be done quickly by sorting the range being covered
- We start from the lowest **start** of range, as it sorted, we can't going back to covered that range any more, so every time, we want to chose the best of the current start range
    - If we can't find any, we can return `-1` , as we need the range to be fully covered
    - If we can find any:
        - Adding it to possible queue `q`
        - Keep running until **start** of range go our of scope.
        - Get the max **end** of range in our `q`.
- Update the current **end** as our new start point.

## Sorted - preprocessing data - chose the best one.
(language:: python) (time:: O(n log n))

```python
class Solution:
    def minTaps(self, n: int, ranges: List[int]) -> int:
        covered = [ (max(0, pos - rang) , pos + rang) for pos, rang in enumerate(ranges)]
        
        def sortKey(x):
            return -x[1]

        covered.sort(key = sortKey)


        def sortKey(x):
            return x[0]
            
        covered.sort(key = sortKey)

        curr = None
        total = 0
        q = []
        for i, j in covered:
            if curr is None:
                curr = j
                total += 1
                continue
            if curr < j and curr >= i:
                q.append(j)
                continue
            if len(q) == 0:
                return -1
            curr = max(q)
            total += 1
            q = []
        if len(q) > 0:
            total += 1
        return total
```

### Problem:

1. Coverage range
    - What I skip (from the problem) is that: The water coverage of each tap is on the tile, while the position of the tap, is the middle, which mean `0` will not covering anything (While `1` will cover 2 tiles).
    - Still, as I representing `covered` range as `(max(0, pos - rang) , pos + rang)`, we can just not including `pos + rang` in the ranges, this will work wonder

2. Not handle the finishing range well:
    - Only n is needed, which mean, if the covered range is `curr > n`, we can return the total, instead of keep looping.
    - This can also be fixed if we create a max cap for covered range, by adding `min(pos + rang, n)` instead of just `pos + rang`

3. Adding the current tap to queue, right after choosing tap. As I only use `q = []`, the current tap isn't being processed. `q.append(j)` 

4. Adding more skip:
    - If covered range `curr` is already covered the current tap, `curr >= j` , we can skip over the tap, this also make the choosing next tap `curr = max(q)` less bug
    - This also mean adding condition the current tap `if (curr < j): q.append(j)` from (3)

```python
class Solution:
    def minTaps(self, n: int, ranges: List[int]) -> int:
        covered = [ (max(0, pos - rang) , min(pos + rang, n)) for pos, rang in enumerate(ranges)]
        # print(covered)

        def sortKey(x):
            return -x[1]

        covered.sort(key = sortKey)


        def sortKey(x):
            return x[0]
            
        covered.sort(key = sortKey)
        # print(covered)
        curr = None
        total = 0
        q = []
        for i, j in covered:
            # print(curr, i, j, q)
            if curr is None:
                curr = j
                total += 1
                continue
            if curr >= j:
                continue
            if curr < j and curr >= i:
                q.append(j)
                continue
            if len(q) == 0:
                return -1
            curr = max(q)
            total += 1
            q = []
            if (curr < j):
                q.append(j)
        if len(q) > 0:
            total += 1
        return total
```

Time complexity: O(n log n)
- Sorted covered range, make it O(n log n)
- There is 2 loop, first loop is O(n)
- The second, is max(q) is independent with the first loop, cost O(n)

> We can reduce the need to call max(q), to reducing even more space needed. But this also mean we want a better way to store covered, which already cost O(n) space.

### Optimizing - No more sort
(language:: python) (time:: O(n))

I used the same input processing as the Solve that Leetcode done, this way, I can reduce the need of sorting the covered range.

```python
class Solution:
    def minTaps(self, n: int, ranges: List[int]) -> int:
        covered = [-1] * (n + 1)

        for i, r in enumerate(ranges):
            covered[max(0, i - r)] = min(n, i + r)

        curr = None
        total = 0
        q = []
        for i, j in enumerate(covered):
            # print(curr, i, j, q)
            if curr is None:
                curr = j
                total += 1
                continue
            if curr >= j:
                continue
            if curr < j and curr >= i:
                q.append(j)
                continue
            if len(q) == 0:
                return -1
            curr = max(q)
            total += 1
            q = []
            if (curr < j):
                q.append(j)
        if len(q) > 0:
            total += 1
        return total
```

### Optimizing 2 - No more `Max(arr)`
(language:: python) (time:: O(n))

It still a nested loop (even it independent with above loop) with a lot of memory allocating for array vector `q`.
This could be done over a single `nextMax` variable.

        covered = [-1] * (n + 1)

        for i, r in enumerate(ranges):
            covered[max(0, i - r)] = min(n, i + r)

        curr = None

            if (curr < j):
                nextMax = max(nextMax, j)
        if nextMax > 0:
            total += 1
        return total
```
## Actual O(n)
(language:: python) (time:: O(n))

The cleaver way to preprocess the data
```python
        # Create a list to track the maximum reach for each position
        max_reach = [0] * (n + 1)

        # Calculate the maximum reach for each tap
        for i in range(len(ranges)):
            # Calculate the leftmost position the tap can reach
            start = max(0, i - ranges[i])
            # Calculate the rightmost position the tap can reach
            end = min(n, i + ranges[i])

            # Update the maximum reach for the leftmost position
            max_reach[start] = max(max_reach[start], end)
```

This way we can effective create the same data which our sort want to achieved. 


```python
class Solution:
    def minTaps(self, n: int, ranges: List[int]) -> int:
        # Create a list to track the maximum reach for each position
        max_reach = [0] * (n + 1)

        # Calculate the maximum reach for each tap
        for i in range(len(ranges)):
            # Calculate the leftmost position the tap can reach
            start = max(0, i - ranges[i])
            # Calculate the rightmost position the tap can reach
            end = min(n, i + ranges[i])

            # Update the maximum reach for the leftmost position
            max_reach[start] = max(max_reach[start], end)
        
        # Number of taps used
        taps = 0
        # Current rightmost position reached
        curr_end = 0
        # Next rightmost position that can be reached
        next_end = 0

        # Iterate through the garden
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i > next_end:
                # Current position cannot be reached
                return -1

            if i > curr_end:
                # Increment taps when moving to a new tap
                taps += 1
                # Move to the rightmost position that can be reached
                curr_end = next_end

            # Update the next rightmost position that can be reached
            next_end = max(next_end, max_reach[i])

        # Return the minimum number of taps used
        return taps
```
