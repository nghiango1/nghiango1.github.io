# Problem

You have `n` computers. You are given the integer `n` and a **0-indexed** integer array `batteries` where the `ith` battery can **run** a computer for `batteries[i]` minutes. You are interested in running **all** `n` computers **simultaneously** using the given batteries.

Initially, you can insert **at most one battery** into each computer. After that and at any integer time moment, you can remove a battery from a computer and insert another battery **any number of times**. The inserted battery can be a totally new battery or a battery from another computer. You may assume that the removing and inserting processes take no time.

Note that the batteries cannot be recharged.

Return _the **maximum** number of minutes you can run all the_ `n` _computers simultaneously._

# Solve
## First implementation - Simulation

```python
class Solution:
    def maxRunTime(self, n: int, batteries: List[int]) -> int:
        if n == len(batteries):
            return min(batteries)
        
        time = 0
        
        while len(batteries) >= n:
            batteries.sort(reverse = True)
            runOut = []
            for i in range(n):
                batteries[i] = batteries[i] - 1
                if batteries[i] == 0:
                    runOut.append(i)
            for i in runOut[::-1]:
                batteries.pop(i)
            time += 1
        
        return time
```
