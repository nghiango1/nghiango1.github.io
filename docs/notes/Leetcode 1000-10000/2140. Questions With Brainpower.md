# Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `questions` where `questions[i] = [pointsi, brainpoweri]`.

The array describes the questions of an exam, where you have to process the questions **in order** (i.e., starting from question `0`) and make a decision whether to **solve** or **skip** each question. Solving question `i` will **earn** you `pointsi` points but you will be **unable** to solve each of the next `brainpoweri` questions. If you skip question `i`, you get to make the decision on the next question.

- For example, given `questions = [[3, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4], [2, 5|3, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4], [2, 5]]`:
    - If question `0` is solved, you will earn `3` points but you will be unable to solve questions `1` and `2`.
    - If instead, question `0` is skipped and question `1` is solved, you will earn `4` points but you will be unable to solve questions `2` and `3`.

Return _the **maximum** points you can earn for the exam_.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= questions.length <= 105`
- `questions[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= pointsi, brainpoweri <= 105`

**Example 1:**

```markdown
**Input:** questions = [[3,2],[4,3],[4,4],[2,5|3,2],[4,3],[4,4],[2,5]]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The maximum points can be earned by solving questions 0 and 3.
- Solve question 0: Earn 3 points, will be unable to solve the next 2 questions
- Unable to solve questions 1 and 2
- Solve question 3: Earn 2 points
Total points earned: 3 + 2 = 5. There is no other way to earn 5 or more points.
```

Info: https://leetcode.com/problems/solving-questions-with-brainpower/

This is the one I come up with:
```python
class Solution:
    def mostPoints(self, questions: List[List[int]]) -> int:
		self.n = questions.__len__()
		self.trace = [[0,0] for i in range(self.n)]
		i = 0
		for v,bp in questions[::-1]:
			if i > 0:
				self.trace[i][0]=max(self.trace[i-1][0], self.trace[i-1][1])
			if i-bp-1<0:
				self.trace[i][1] = v
			else:
				self.trace[i][1] = v + max(self.trace[i-bp-1][0], self.trace[i-bp-1][1])
			i+= 1

		return max(self.trace[self.n-1][0], self.trace[self.n-1][1])
```

# First look
## Problem analised
Giving the problem with the skipping, it get a bit tricky:
1. Let say you go from the first to last question,
	1. If there is only one question ```questions[0]```, then chose to do the first question ```questions[0]```  will give the most point. We have `maxPoint( questions[0] ) = q[0].value `
	2. But if there is 2 question, there will be 2 case: 
		1. We want to do the second question, which lead to 2 child case:
			1. We want to do only the second question:
				1. This mean `questions[1].value >= question[0].value`
				2. ```questions[0]``` .brainPower >= 1: which mean if we try to do it, we need to skip at least 1 question, meanning skip the second question ```questions[1]``` 
				3. maxPoint( ```questions[0..1]``` ) = q\[1].value 
			2. We can do both questtion
				1. ```questions[0]``` .brainPower == 0: which mean if we try to do it, we can still do the second question ```questions[1]``` 
				2. maxPoint( ```questions[0..1]``` ) = q\[1].value + q\[0].value
		2. We don't want to do the second question
			1. This mean ```questions[1]``` . value < ```question[0]``` .value
			2. ```questions[0]``` .brainPower >= 1: which mean if we try to do it, we need to skip at least 1 question, meanning skip the second question ```questions[1]```
			3. maxPoint( ```questions[0..1]``` ) =  q\[0].value
	3.  Let keep it going: add the third question, the best point of current could be:
		1. We want to do  the third question
			1. We want to do only the third question
				1. This mean ```questions[2]``` . value >= the maxPoint(question\[0..1])
				2. Also,  ```questions[i]``` .brainPower >= 1 + i (i=\[0..1]) : which mean if we try to do it, we need to skip the third question ```questions[2]``` 
				3. We could see a recusive approad here
			2. We could do the third question, but we need to find
				1. ```questions[i]``` .brainPower < 1 + i (i=\[0..1]): which mean if we do it, we can still do the third question ```questions[2]``` 
				2. Here, we can see a **bad** partent:
					1. If we can find a matching ```questions[i]``` .brainPower < 1+ i: maxPoint(question\[0..i]) still isn't mean we have used ```questions[i]``` in it
					2. Which lead to a seperated:
						1. maxPoint(question\[0..i]) that use ```questions[i]``` and have the corresponding ```questions[i]```.brainPower
						2. maxPoint(question\[0..i]) that not ```questions[i]``` and we need to trace back which is the last ``question[j]`` (j != i) being done, and what is it's corresponding brainPower
					3. This could mean we have to handle traceback/max table for each of there case
		2. We skip the third question: Well, which mean we can keep the maxPoint(question\[0..1]) of two last question
2. This could mean we have a O(n^2) if we not careful to handle the trace back and find the best maxPoint(question\[0..i])

## First implementation
Still, here could be the answer

```python
class Solution:
    def mostPoints(self, questions: List[List[int]]) -> int:
		self.n = questions.__len__()
		# Define trace array for trace back -1 mean we have no traceback; first value is the last question we do when we not do the question [i], second value is when we do the question [i] 
		self.trace = [[-1,i] for i in range(self.n)]
		# Define max array to give us a maxPoint table for cache the result instead of calling mostPoint over and over; Simmilar to trace, the first value is when we not do the question [i], second one is when we do the question[i] 
		self.max = [[0,0] for i in range(self.n)]
		i = 0
		for v,bp in questions:
			# Handle the first one
			if i==0:
				self.max[i][0]= 0
				self.max[i][1] = questions[0][0]
				self.trace[i][0] = -1
				self.trace[i][1] = 0
				continue
			
			# find max case
			innerMax = 0
			innerTrace = -1
			for innerIndex in range(i):
				if self.trace[innerIndex][0] != -1:
					if innerMax < self.max[innerIndex][0]:
						innerMax = self.max[innerIndex][0]
						innerTrace = self.trace[innerIndex][0
					if innerMax < self.max[innerIndex][0]:
						innerMax = self.max[innerIndex][0]
						innerTrace = self.trace[innerIndex][0]
					# TODO............
			i+= 1

		return max(self.trace[self.n-1][0], self.trace[self.n-1][1])
```

The code it self become too much of a head ache; and also, the double for loop make me feel like there should be a better solution.

This is when i revaluate the aproad for better solution and also, fix the mess code above.

## Revaluate
1. We could go back-ward, doing the last question back to the first question. 
	1. This make the brainPower from from skip "ahead" infomation problem (Which later information being rely on a lot of trace back info and need all history data for processing) : `MaxPoint(question[0..i]) = max(question[i].value + maxPoint(question[0..i-1]) that isn't *require* question[i] to be skip, maxPoint(question[0..i-1]))`
	2. into a skip "behind" problem (Which we can predicted exact infomation needed): when doing question[i], the maxPoint value after skipping question[i].brainPower will alway be `question[i].value + maxPoint([i+question[i].brainPower .. n])` without any condition: `maxPoint(question[i..n]) = max(question[i].value + maxPoint([i+question[i].brainPower .. n]), maxPoint(question[i+1..n]))`
2. Now that more like it; we not need to go and code to finding something weird like `that isn't *require* question[i] to be skip`

## Recusive approad

```python
class Solution:
    def mostPoints(self, questions: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if questions.__len__() == 0:
            return 0
        n = questions.__len__()
        v = questions[0][0]
        bp = questions[0][1]
        return max(v + self.mostPoints(questions[bp+1:n]), self.mostPoints( questions[1:n]))
```

quite slow tho; also, this is when i learn about `@cache` in python; it can't be use for List type, so just global the question infomation and instead using index value as parameter. Here is a updated code

```python
class Solution:
	@cache
	def maxPoints(self, x):
		if x>=self.n:
			return 0
        v = self.questions[x][0]
        bp = self.questions[x][1]
        return max(v + self.maxPoints(x+bp+1), self.maxPoints(x+1))


    def mostPoints(self, questions: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        self.n = questions.__len__()
        self.questions = questions
        return maxPoints(0)
```

## Dynamic approad

Yeah, just do it at this point; These should be better to understand than my first submit

```python
class Solution:
    def mostPoints(self, questions: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = questions.__len__()
        maxTable = [0]*n
        maxTable[n-1] = questions[n-1][0]
        i = n-2
        for v, bp in questions[::-1]:
            if i+bp+1 < n:
                v += maxTable[i+bp+1] 
            maxTable[i] = max(v, maxTable[i+1])
            i -= 1
        return maxTable[0]
```

1. The first submit code [i] value will be separate if I do it or not
2. I using hard code to separate the len = 1 (which turn into an if statement inside the for loop in the first submit code)
3. Invert the for loop index value from n down to 1; instead couting up 1 to n like in the first submit code.
