# Problem

We have `n` buildings numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Each building has a number of employees. It's transfer season, and some employees want to change the building they reside in.

You are given an array `requests` where `requests[i] = [from_i, to_i]` represents an employee's request to transfer from building `from_i` to building `to_i`.

**All buildings are full**, so a list of requests is achievable only if for each building, the **net change in employee transfers is zero**. This means the number of employees **leaving** is **equal** to the number of employees **moving in**. For example if `n = 3` and two employees are leaving building `0`, one is leaving building `1`, and one is leaving building `2`, there should be two employees moving to building `0`, one employee moving to building `1`, and one employee moving to building `2`.

Return _the maximum number of achievable requests_

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 20`
- `1 <= requests.length <= 16`
- `requests[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= from_i, to_i < n`

# Solution
## Read the problem
- There is really low number of request and building. So we can try all possible request combination

## Evaluating
- Using a binary array to keep track of which request are served  `served = [False] * requests.length` , free slot start on each building is `[0] * n`
- Let say for each request being done, we mark them as `True`, we then have a combination of `2 ** requests.length <= 2 **16` or `65536`  total of possible out come
- With each one, we can then try and find the total of person in each building, is it all equal to `0`? Which cost us a total time complexity  `O(n) <= 20`.
- If that true, then is could be possible answer and we can update the `current_max`.
- Know possible answer `current_max`, we will only try to check any `served` where total number of request being served is greater than  `current_max`;

>Which mean time complexity is close to `O(n* 2**m) = 20*65536` 

## Get it on
- A binary representation is good enough for `served` array. We can use a for loop in range `[0 .. 2**16]`. Every `1`  position in binary number representation mean request at that position is served 

## Implementation
### Sane way
```python
class Solution:
    def bit_1_pos(self, number):
        for pos, c in enumerate(bin(number)[2:][::-1]):
            if c == '1':
                yield pos

    def maximumRequests(self, n: int, requests: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        current_max = 0
        
        for request_served in range(1 << requests.__len__()):
            building = [0] * n
            pos = requests.__len__() - 1
            if request_served.bit_count() <= current_max:
                continue
                
            for pos in self.bit_1_pos(request_served):
                building[requests[pos][0]] -= 1
                building[requests[pos][1]] += 1
				
            check = True
            for i in range(n):
                if building[i] != 0:
                    check = False
                    break
                    
            if check:
                current_max = request_served.bit_count()

        return current_max
```
