# Problem

There are `n` points on a road you are driving your taxi on. The `n` points on the road are labeled from `1` to `n` in the direction you are going, and you want to drive from point `1` to point `n` to make money by picking up passengers. You cannot change the direction of the taxi.

The passengers are represented by a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `rides`, where `rides[i] = [starti, endi, tipi]` denotes the `ith` passenger requesting a ride from point `starti` to point `endi` who is willing to give a `tipi` dollar tip.

For **each** passenger `i` you pick up, you **earn** `endi - starti + tipi` dollars. You may only drive **at most one** passenger at a time.

Given `n` and `rides`, return _the **maximum** number of dollars you can earn by picking up the passengers optimally._

**Note:** You may drop off a passenger and pick up a different passenger at the same point.

**Example 1:**
```markdown
**Input:** n = 5, rides = [[2,5,4],[1,5,1|2,5,4],[1,5,1]]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** We can pick up passenger 0 to earn 5 - 2 + 4 = 7 dollars.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10**5`
- `1 <= rides.length <= 3 * 10**4`
- `rides[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= start_i < end_i <= n`
- `1 <= tip_i <= 10**5`

# Solve
This need some Dynamic programming

## Minimize memory allocation solution 
- Closely related to [[1751. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II|1751. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II]], where I use a binary search to stored best found choosing rides/events with each `end` at position `index`. Storing it it in a  `lookup` array, we have either:
	- **(Case 1)** Last found best rides array `lookup[end] = lookup[end-1]` 
	- **(Case 2)** Choosing current ride and best found `[..., end]` with `end < start[index]`. `lookup[end] = value_of_the_ride + lookup[start-1]`  

> `end-1` or `start-1` here is just for representation, as I try to minimize the total memory for the `lookup` array by using Binary search instead.

- Sorting: To get the best result, any possible ride we can take between two ride in **(Case 2)** need to already process. so we need to sort `rides` array by `end` to make sure our calculated in a right order.
- Storing: With two array `key`, and `lookup` which is where we save the current `end` and total `value` of the path (now tbh, `key` isn't doing that much as it just a better way to get `[r[1] for r in rides[:index]]`), 

```python
class Solution:
    def maxTaxiEarnings(self, n: int, rides: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def sort_key_end(x):
            return x[1]
        
        def binary_search(arr, value):
            l = -1
            r = len(arr)
            while l+1<r:
                m = (l + r) //2
                curr_val = arr[m]
                if curr_val <= value:
                    l = m
                else:
                    r = m
            is_found = l > -1
            return is_found, l

        rides.sort(key=sort_key_end)
        lookup = []
        key = []
        for index, (s, e, v) in enumerate(rides):
            lookup.append(e - s + v)
            key.append(e)
            is_found, possible = binary_search(key, s)
            if is_found:
                lookup[index] += lookup[possible]
            if lookup[index] < lookup[index - 1]:
                lookup[index] = lookup[index - 1]
        
        return lookup[len(rides)-1]
```

## Using hash map to sort instead

We can using a hash map with `dict()` instead for better sorting in O(n) time complexity and O(1) look up too, here is a lazy `Crtl + C` implementation:
- This sorted rides by `start` instead (which making you need to go backward from `end` to `start` instead)
- The checking parse get all possible **(case 2)** at current position, find the max one with `max(dp[i], dp[e] + d)`, after all of that, recheck **(case 1)** with final update `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i + 1])`
```python
class Solution:
    def maxTaxiEarnings(self, n: int, rides: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rideStartAt = defaultdict(list)
        for s, e, t in rides:
            rideStartAt[s].append([e, e - s + t])
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
            for e, d in rideStartAt[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[e] + d)
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i + 1])

        return dp[1]
```

Quick rewrite it again, yeah, same thing.
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict


class Solution:
    def maxTaxiEarnings(self, n: int, rides: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rideStartAt = defaultdict(list)
        for start, end, tip in rides:
            rideStartAt[start].append([end, end - start + tip])
        lookup = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
            for end, true_value in rideStartAt[i]:
                lookup[i] = max(lookup[i], lookup[end] + true_value)
            lookup[i] = max(lookup[i], lookup[i + 1])

        return lookup[1]
```

> We just storing in a normal array instead of using binary search

My first implementation is affected by [[1751. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II|1751. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II]], the binary search part isn't necessary and increasing a lot of computed time.

Here is implementation my re implementation which `lookup` is an array with its range is base on `n` (the worst case it is only `[0..10**5]`). Which return the [Accepted](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/994983258/) with `1550 ms`
```python
class Solution_2:
    def maxTaxiEarnings(self, n: int, rides: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def sort_key_end(x):
            return x[1]

        rides.sort(key=sort_key_end)
        lookup = [0] * (n + 1)
        car_pos = 1
        for s, e, v in rides:
            for i in range(car_pos, e):
                lookup[i] = lookup[car_pos]
            car_pos = e
            possible = (e - s + v)
            if s > 0:
                possible += lookup[s]
            lookup[e] = max(lookup[e], lookup[e-1], possible)

        return lookup[car_pos]
```

## Looking for the best of best implementation?
Here is sample `1542 ms` submission
```python
class Solution:
    def maxTaxiEarnings(self, n: int, rides: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rides.sort(key=lambda r: r[1])
        cur = [-1]
        dollars = [0]

        for st, ed, tip in rides:
            i = bisect_right(cur, st)
            earn = dollars[i - 1] + ed - st + tip
            dollars.append(max(dollars[-1], earn))
            cur.append(ed)
        return dollars[-1]
```

[Python](Python.md) isn't that fast, so anything that you get from standard library will get you quite far on the leader board. `bisect_right` being use here is a [python array](Python%20array#Bisect%20Algorithm%20Functions%20in%20Python%7Cpython%20array.md) helper function that alternate Binary search implementation.

- There is a lot of similarity to the first implementation. My retry on rewriting the same function
```python
class Solution:
    def maxTaxiEarnings(self, n: int, rides: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def sort_key_end(x):
            return x[1]

        rides.sort(key=sort_key_end)
        key = [-1]
        lookup = [0]

        for start, end, tip in rides:
            search = bisect_right(key, start)
            true_rides_value = lookup[search - 1] + end - start + tip
            lookup.append(max(lookup[-1], true_rides_value))
            key.append(end)
        return lookup[-1]
```
