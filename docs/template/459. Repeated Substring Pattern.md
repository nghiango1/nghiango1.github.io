# Problem

Given a string `s`, check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abab"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** It is the substring "ab" twice.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "aba"
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "abcabcabcabc"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** It is the substring "abc" four times or the substring "abcabc" twice.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10**4`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

# Solve

## Brute force
(language:: python)

The easiest way to do any problem, is that we check all possible solution, we already have a conclusion that from the problem given 

> we can create `s` by *appending multiple copies* of `sub` substring of `s`

Which mean, `len(s) % len(sub) == 0`

After that, we just check one by one if our `sub` string is on repeat or not by split `s` into multiple substring with length equal to the length of `sub` string.

While this generally a bad way to solve this question, but in python:
- String comparing always a hash compare, which cost less than a full string comparing one by one character
- We doing way less than `10**4` on the first loop, as we have to enforce `len(s) % len(sub) == 0` before doing the second loop

```python
class Solution:
    def repeatedSubstringPattern(self, s: str) -> bool:
        n = len(s)
        for i in range(1, n):
            if n % i != 0:
                continue

            sub = s[:i]
            res = True
            for step in range(n//i):
                if sub != s[step*i: (step+1) * i]:
                    res = False
                    break
            if res:
                return True

        return False
```

## Rust brute force
(language:: rust)

While thinking about it, I too, checking how rust implement the string comparing. As there isn't much different when I try to implement the same code line by line in rust
