# Variable
- Assigned using `let` keyword
- Print to standard output by `print! ( )` or `println! ()`
- **Scope** of a variable defined by the **block of code** in which it is declared
- Function is a named block of code that is reusable
- Shadowing allows a variable to be re-declared in the same scope with the same name
