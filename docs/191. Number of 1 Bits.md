# Problem

Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

**Constraints:**

- The input must be a **binary string** of length `32`.

**Note:**

- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). Therefore, in **Example 3**, the input represents the signed integer. `-3`.

**Example 1:**
```markdown
**Input:** n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The input binary string **00000000000000000000000000001011** has a total of three '1' bits.
```

Python have a exact function `int.bit_count()` to do this task

```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        return n.bit_count()
```

Other than that could be: Turn any number to binary
```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        return bin(n)[2:].count("1")
```

While with C/C++, counting using bit manipulation
```c
int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
    int count = 0;
    while (n != 0) {
        count += n & 1; // count = count + n % 2;
        n >>= 1; // n = n / 2
    }
    return count;
}
```
