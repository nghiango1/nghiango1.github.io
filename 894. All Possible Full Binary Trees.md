# Problem

Given an integer `n`, return _a list of all possible **full binary trees** with_ `n` _nodes_. Each node of each tree in the answer must have `Node.val == 0`.

Each element of the answer is the root node of one possible tree. You may return the final list of trees in **any order**.

A **full binary tree** is a binary tree where each node has exactly `0` or `2` children.

**Example 1:**

```markdown
**Input:** n = 7
**Output:** [[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,0,0|0,0,0,null,null,0,0,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,0,0]]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 20`

# Solve
## Over complicating simulation approach
#hash 

There isn't any thing said we could reused the tree node, which I mean all `TreeNode` object from Root A should be different from Root B . We assuming that this **No reused** rule is required.

We try to build up all solution from bottom:
- If `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`), there are no possible full binary trees since we always need to have an odd number of nodes to form a full binary tree.
- If `n` is 1, there is only one possible full binary tree with a single node having a value of 0.

For any odd `n = 2x + 1`, where `x` is an integer, we can generate the full binary trees from the previous `n - 2 = 2x - 1` trees. We use the following building blocks:
- `self.roots`: We keep track of an array of roots math have previous `n-2` nodes, which starting with a tree containing a single node with value 0 when `n = 1`.
- `self.leafs`: We also keep track of all leaf nodes in each tree of `self.roots` array. The purpose of this is to quickly add new nodes directly to the leaf nodes instead of looping through all the nodes to find the leaf nodes.

> In the implementation, I using `tuple` to store both of `self.roots` and `self.leafs` in one array `self.roots` 

We then follow these steps to build the trees:
1. We start with `n = 1`, and initialize `self.roots` with a tree containing a single node with value 0. Also, we initialize `self.leafs[root] = [<all leaf nodes of the root tree>]`.
2. For any `n = 2x + 1` (where `n = 3, 5, 7, ...`), we try to generate new trees from the previous `n - 2` trees. To do this efficiently:
    1. We loop through each `curr_root` root tree in `self.roots` and their corresponded `self.leafs`
    2. **(Step 2)** Add two leaf nodes to any of this root leaf.
    3. Use the `copyTree` function to create a copy of the all tree and then revert the change from step 2. 
    4. We then hash the new tree using the `hashNode` function to check for any collision with previously generated trees.
    5.  If there is no collision (the hash is not in `visited`), we add the new tree to the `result` list along with its leaf nodes.
    6. Update our `self.roots` to new `result`
3. We continue this process until we reach `n`. Finally, we return the generated trees in `self.roots`

The simulation-based approach works, but it is unnecessarily complex and slow due to the copying of trees and hash computations.

```python
class Solution:
    def hashNode(self, root, index = 1):
        if root is None:
            return 0
        result = index << 5 + index
        if root.left:
            result += self.hashNode(root.left, 2*index)
        if root.right:
            result += self.hashNode(root.right, 2*index + 1)
        return result
    
    def copyTree(self, source):
        result = None
        leafs = []
        result = TreeNode(source.val)
        if source.left:
            result.left, leafsLeft = self.copyTree(source.left)
            leafs += leafsLeft
        if source.right:
            result.right, leafsRight = self.copyTree(source.right)
            leafs += leafsRight
        if source.left is None and source.right is None:
            leafs.append(result)
        return result, leafs
    
    def addLeaf(self):
        result = []
        visited = set()
        for root, leafs in self.roots:
            for leaf in leafs[::-1]:
                leaf.left = TreeNode(0)
                leaf.right = TreeNode(0)

                new_root, new_leafs = self.copyTree(root)
                hashN = self.hashNode(new_root)
                if hashN not in visited:
                    result.append((new_root, new_leafs))
                    visited.add(hashN)

                leaf.left = None
                leaf.right = None
        return result
    
    def allPossibleFBT(self, n: int) -> List[Optional[TreeNode]]:
        if n%2 == 0:
            return []
        self.roots = []
        for i in range(1, n+1, 2):
            tmp = []
            if i == 1:
                root = TreeNode(0)
                tmp = [(root, [root])]
                self.roots = tmp
                continue
            tmp = self.addLeaf()
            self.roots = tmp
            
        return [root for root, _ in self.roots]
```

## Minimal

The simulation approach can be greatly simplified using dynamic programming and memorization to avoid redundant computations.

We use the following steps to find all possible full binary trees with `n` nodes:

1. If `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`), there are no possible full binary trees, so we return an empty list.
2. If `n` is 1, there is only one possible full binary tree with a single node having a value of 0. We return this tree as a list containing a single node.
3. For any odd `n = 2x + 1` (where `x` is an integer), we recursively find all possible full binary trees for each possible left subtree with nodes `i` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `n - 1` with a step of 2), and the right subtree with nodes `n - i - 1`. We then combine these left and right subtrees with a root having a value of 0, and add them to the result list.
4. We use memorization to store the results of subproblems in the `cache` dictionary to avoid redundant computations.

The minimal approach is much more efficient and straightforward, and it accurately finds all possible full binary trees with `n` nodes, each having a root node with a value of 0. It returns the final list of trees in any order.

```python
class Solution:
    def allPossibleFBT(self, n: int, cache = None) -> List[TreeNode]:
        if cache is None:
            cache = {}
        
        if n in cache:
            return cache[n]
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            return []
        if n == 1:
            cache[n] = [TreeNode()]
            return [TreeNode()]
        
        res = []
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            left = self.allPossibleFBT(i, cache)
            right = self.allPossibleFBT(n - i - 1, cache)

            for l in left:
                for r in right:
                    root = TreeNode(0, l, r)
                    res.append(root)

        cache[n] = res
        return res
